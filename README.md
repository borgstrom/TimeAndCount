# Time and Count

Whenever I cook with tortillas at home I heat them up in a pan and transfer them to the tortillero. I use a timer for 30 seconds on each side and when I have to heat up ~15 tortillas I often end up lost in thought and lose track of if I have flipped the current tortilla and how many I've done so far.

I always wished the built in Timer in the Clock app had a counter...

Lately I've been interested in exploring app development in Swift/SwiftUI and figured this would be a good first project.
